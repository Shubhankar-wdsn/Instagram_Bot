# Instagram_Bot
Managing an Instagram account for a firm takes a lot of time and effort.  Replying to comments, posting new content, monitoring brand mentions and numerous other tasks fill up your day. As a result, several marketers resort to Instagram automation, including tools frequently referred to as ‘Instagram bots,’ to save time and take care of some of the more monotonous aspects of Instagram marketing. I built this bot with the help of Python 3.8 and Selenium package.  Selenium package bindings provides a simple API to write functional/acceptance tests using Selenium Web Driver. Selenium Python bindings provide a convenient API to access Selenium Web Drivers like Firefox,  Chrome, Remote etc.  This was a fun little project which gave me a vague idea about how web automation works and what it's pros and cons are. To further build upon this project, I might add features like commenting on posts having similar tags and downloading a users image media.
